Command-line Params
I typically run with the -url and -dest options.  I set these in the IDE's run params input box.  I'm not running from the command-line yet,
only from the IDE.  For example

    -url http://www.abcnews.com -dest /Users/pgrandje/MyProjects/testgentests/mygeneratedpageobjects



Code Template Files Location:
Configuration files are in the RunFolder/resources and is not the root of the project,
it's a subfolder and is set in the IDE's run configuration settings.  Also the logs get written to the RunFolder.
